# Chat Application
## Summary
This is just a simple chat application using Java sockets that I'd developed for a quick university project. More changes can be added to it and it can be stabilized as it does not use the best alrogithms possible and can get rather unstable, so do bear that in mind while using it.

## Requirements
JDK 11
Netbeans (Preferable but Optional)

## Usage
Open the folder in netbeans as a project and run one instance of Server.java. The server is used to log newly connected clients along with their requests. It must be run first or else the client application wouldn't operate as expected. Then, run as many instances needed of Client.java. Every instance represents a user, able to initiate chats with new individuals, check if they are online or offline, receive message from other individuals, edit their profiles, and log out, all in real-time.
